Now, here are some additional tips to make prompting easier for you:

    Res: 832x1216
    Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras
    Steps: 30-40 CFG: 3-7 (less is a bit more realistic)
    Negative: Start with no negative, and add afterwards the Stuff you don't want to see in that image. I don't recommend using my Negative Prompt, i simply use it because i am lazy :D

VAE is already Baked In HiRes: 4xNMKD-Siax_200k with 15 Steps and 0.3 Denoise + 1.5 Upscale And a few keywords/tokens that I regularly use in training, which might help you achieve the optimal result from the version:
